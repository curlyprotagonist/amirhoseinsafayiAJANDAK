Here's a simple script that uses the built-in echo function to output the text "The Best PHP Examples" to the page:
start//

<?php
  // This is a single-line comment
  
  # You can also make single-line comments like this
?>
<?php
/*
This comment block spans
over multiple 
lines
*/
?>

END//

Variables
Variables are the main way to store information in a PHP program.

All variables in PHP start with a leading dollar sign like $variable_name.
To assign a variable, use the = operator, 
with the name of the variable on the left and the expression to be evaluated on the right.

Syntax:
<?php
// Assign the value "Hello!" to the variable "greeting"
$greeting = "Hello!";
// Assign the value 8 to the variable "month"
$month = 8;
// Assign the value 2019 to the variable "year"
$year = 2019;
?>
